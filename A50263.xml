            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>If a Wall be 13 foot high, find 13 foot in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, and againſt it is 20 Foot 11 Inches, ſheweth that 20 Foot and

               <p>The firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn is the height in Feet.</p>

               <p>Do thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt meaſure how many Rods you have upon the ſide of the Wall (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) and take that number, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply it by the number of the half Bricks that the Wall is in thickneſs, and that product divide always by 3, and the Quotient will ſhew how many Rods of Standard-Meaſure is in the Wall.</p>
               <p>If one Yard, Pound, Buſhel, Load or Quart coſt me ſo many pence, what will any number of Yards, Pounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> coſt me?</p>
               <p>Always multiply the number of Yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that you would buy, by the number of pence that one Yard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will coſt, and the product will ſhew

               <p>Wherefore we may plainly ſee, that God, the living God, doth govern all the World by his only Wiſdom and Providence, ſo that we ſee here is no place for the ſecundarian Intelligences of the Aſtrologians, whereupon it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be ſeen, that their ſecundari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Intelligences are only pernitious and ſuperſtitious Fables, whereby the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers are deluded by the Devil, in that they Idolize the Stars, and are deceived in their Planetary Angels, who they think are the good Angels of God: But the Aſtrologers, and all other that think thoſe ſeven Angels which the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers call Planetary Angels, are good Angels, I ſay, if any man ſay, that the ſaid Angels are good, I ſay that all ſuch are deluded; for whoſoever ſaith that evil is good, the ſame is deluded; but Aſtrologers do call evil good, in that they do affirm the Planetary Angels to be good Angels, the which ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are Devils, as I ſaid afore: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that no man can by Conjurations

               <p>Morover I ſay, that theſe ſeven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Angels of the Aſtrologers are the chief Agents for Conjurors, — are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Devils, which are alſo the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians chief Agents in all Magical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

Now the Devil maketh out himſelf unto the Aſtrologers in a dark, hidden way, that the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cannot ſee him, although he work continually by him. Now then the way by which the Devil and the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers do work together, is briefly thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Aſtrologers ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regarding of times, and their erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Figure with their obſerving the Poſition of the Stars in the ſaid Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, to this end, that ſo they might know the event of particular things; I ſay, that this regarding of time, and erecting of a Figure, with the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Stars therein, to the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, I ſay it is nothing elſe but vain Ceremonies, whereby the Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angels do come to underſtand and know what it is the Aſtrologer would foretel, or what the thing is, of which the Aſtrologer would predict and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the event thereof. So then the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger's Figure being thus erected, he doth from thence conjecture what ſhall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104906:43"/>be the event of the thing, for which the Figure was erected. Now the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger having thus delivered his Oracle, from thenceforth the Planetary Angels do all that they are able (God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them) to bring to paſs that which the Aſtrologer did foretel. Now why the Devil doth all this, it is to this end, that ſo he may uphold and maintain his Kingdom of Darkneſs.</p>

For</p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Morien,</hi> Who hath it (that is this Stone) poſſeſſeth all things, and ſhall need the help of no body in any thing, becauſe in it is all temporal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, corporal Health, and earthly proſperity. And further the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſaith, that by this Stone or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>Moſes</hi> made the Veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Tabernacle; <hi>Noah</hi> built

               <p>This many do ſeek, (ſay they) but few do find it; for the defiled with vices or polluted are unworthy to know ſuch things: Therefore it is not ſhewn but to the devout, becauſe it is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to all prices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>So that it was by Faith in God, that <hi>Noah, Moſes, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all other the Righteous walked, (but not by Philoſophy, or Aſtrology, or any other created thing;) not like the Gentiles and Aſtrologers, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vain in their Imaginations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and Obſervers of times, for which Sin the Lord drove out the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> out of their Land. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.12, 14. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.26.</p>
               <p>Therefore what man of ſenſe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all the Art of earthly men,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104906:74"/>can procure one thing out of earthly things, that may be but as the quantity of a peaſe, that ſhall have power (being put into a pound or two of melted Lead) to change it into moſt fine Gold, or that this one thing ſhall have alſo power, as an outward Medicine, to cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in the Bodies of the wicked, that they may get ſtrength to be wicked ſtill.</p>
               <p>But moſt happy is he, that above all ſearching, he ſeeketh after, and waiteth upon God, that he may give unto him that white Stone, and in it a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. Now before I conclude, I ſhall recite ſome of the words of two of theſe Philoſophical Writers, as <hi>Geber</hi> and <hi>Villa Nova.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Geber, For whereſoever we have ſpoken plainly, there we have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but where under Riddles and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures we have put ſomething, there we have hid the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Villa Nova <hi>ſaith, The Alchymiſts of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104906:75"/>latter time, are for the moſt part mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and whiles by Sophiſtications, they ſeek rather to ſeem wiſe than to be, they deceive the yielders to them; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients not profiting according to their own Covetouſneſs, have wrapped up this Art in Riddles, ſhewing rather their own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance than Science,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Eph. 5.11. <hi>And have no fellowſhip</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with the unfruitful works of darkneſs; but rather reprove them,</hi> Eph. 4.17, 18.</p>
               <p>Yet the word Philoſophy has ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a love to Wiſdom, and the way to holy Living, and not vain and impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable things. See <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his works; and the Speech of <hi>Palamedes</hi> at his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, manifeſteth, that ſome of them ſought after Righteouſneſs: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I never hurt or injured any, but on the contrary, have advantaged all that converſed with me, to my utmoſt ability, communicating what good I could</hi> gratis, <hi>and not for gain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that all, called Chriſtians, was but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104906:75"/>come ſo far into a righteous Life, as this <hi>Palamedes!</hi> (who was called a Heathen, as his Speech declareth,) then would <hi>England</hi> be happy, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations.</p>
               <p>Note, that if <hi>William Lilly,</hi> and the reſt of the Aſtrologers, do not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be acquainted with the ſeven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Angels of the Magicians, why did he write thus? <hi>viz. For though Philoſophy and Philoſophers teach us, that Comets have a matter, or Ethereal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, of which they are created, yet thoſe learned men, wanting Angelical converſation, are deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Above all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let the Artiſt rather judge by the ſtrength of his reaſon, guided by Art, upon the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations of the Planets, than by ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted Aphoriſms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nor are the ſecundian Intelligences, <hi>viz.</hi> what Angel then governs, to be omitted in Conſideration for the judging of future Events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>There is two fixed Stars, called the two Poles of the World; the North Pole, and the South Pole, oppoſite one to the other, the Earth being in the middle, or betwixt them, and a Line ſuppoſed to be held from the one to the other Star<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:104906:78"/>
               <p>The Sun, Moon and Stars moves round them, and the Earth continually. The Sun giving Light to one place of the Earth at all times<note n="*" place="margin">The People in <hi>New England,</hi> and <hi>New Jerſey</hi> are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of Bed when we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are at Dinner; ſo that we differ ſix hours in time, the Sun making the day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> for mans outward ſight to guide him in outward things, and to refreſh the Earth, (as the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Chriſt Jeſus, cauſeth his Spiritual Light to ſhine in the hearts of all men, to light them out of Darkneſs or Sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.78.)</p>
               <p>So that all earthly things preſſeth to this Earth upon every part thereof to the middle or Center, from whence they ſprung.</p>
               <p>Now to make it more plainly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, I draw a crooked line to repreſent ſome part of the Earth upon which we dwell, in <hi>England,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a doted Line to ſee which of the

               <figure/>
               <p>Now he that travels 60 miles North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the North Star will be a degree higher; or Southwards the contrary; but altereth not to go Eaſtward, or Weſtward directly; (and 360 of theſe degrees is round the Earth, or Globe, as is ſuppoſed.)</p>

               <p>Then remove the diviſor 16, and ſay, how many times 1 in 12? I ſay, 8 times, (but if I had ſaid 9 times, I could not have taken 9 times 6 out of 38) therefore ſet 8 in the Quotient ſaying, 8 times 1 is 8, take 8 from 12 and there reſts 4, ſet 4 over the 12, and cancel the 12.</p>
               <p>Laſtly ſay 8 times 6 is 48, take 48 from 48 and there remains none, or 8 from 8 and 4 from 4, and the work is done, and ſtands thus:

               <p>Note that by the ſame Rule you may alſo reduce ſeveral ſort of weights, or Meaſures, one into another, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing your Queſtion into pounds or ounces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or your Meaſures into feet, inches, or Barley corns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or into pints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and divide the Product by the number of Ounces, or Inches, or Pints, or Els, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is in the meaſures that you would reduce it into,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104906:106"/>(the dividend and the diviſor being both of one denomination) and the Quotient will ſhew the Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Therefore to gain skill, be often try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Pen, which helps more than much reading, and comparing one Rule to another, to ſee how they agree, or differ, by the well peruſing of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the end of this Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>FIrſt, Take a Board of about one foot ſquare, or more, ſet it ſloping like a Desk, that the Light may come under it, in the middle thereof make a hole of what bigneſs you pleaſe, and place a piece of Glaſs therein to lie even with the Board, ſtarch the edge with Paper, and it is ready for uſe.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:104906:107"/>
               <p>Secondly, take your Copy and lay it on the Glaſs, and upon that a piece of Paper, and pin them together at the corners, and then with a Pen you may draw the Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo by uſe you may come to draw without a Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you deſire to draw a great Letter or other thing, greater or leſs than the Copy, draw croſs Lines with black Lead of an equal diſtance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Letter or Copy, (which you may rub out again with the crumbs of white Bread,) like unto a harrow.</p>
               <p>Then draw upon your Paper as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſs Lines, at equal Diſtance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you would have your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in bigneſs, obſerving that you draw the parts of the Letter C in each ſquare that anſwereth them in your Paper.</p>

               <p>IN the beginning of the Reformation (in King <hi>Henry</hi> 8th's time) one <hi>Cromwel</hi> was greatly in favour with the King, and was made one of his Privy Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He brought to light and ſuppreſſed many Popiſh Idolatrous Images, and other ſuperſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for which they ſought his death, which the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards lamented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One Rood of Grace or Image, wherein a man ſtood incloſed with a hundred Wires within the Rood, to make the Image goggle its Eyes, nod its head, hang the Lip, move and ſhake its Jaws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of the gift offered; if it were a ſmall piece of Silver, then would he hang a frowning Lip, if it were a piece of Gold, then ſhould his Jaws go merrily: Thus were poor peoples Souls ſeduced, and their Pockets pick'd by theſe Idolatrous forgers, until <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> cauſed the ſaid Image to be carried publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Pauls</hi> (in <hi>London,</hi>) where the People tore it in pieces.</p>
               <p>Then in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time (Daughter to the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th,) Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> put out a Mandate to the Prieſts within his Dioceſs,

Well, ſaid the Mayor, though you like not the Rood, the poor mans labour has been never the leſs, and it's pitty he ſhould loſe; but I tell you what you ſhall do, pay him the Money you promiſed him, and if it will not ſerve you for a God, you may make a Devil of it, at which they laughed, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104906:135"/>hurt a man; and he that ſayeth ſo or ſo unto a man, he cannot hurt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that whiſpereth over a Wound, or readeth a verſe out of the Bible; likewiſe he that readeth over an Infant, that it may not be frighted, or that layeth the Book of the Law, or the Philacteries upon a Child that it may ſleep; ſuch are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Inchanters or Charmers, but of thoſe that generally deny the Law of God; becauſe (ſaith he) they make the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture medicine for the Body, whereas they are not; but medicine for the Soul, as it is written <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22. <hi>They ſhall be life unto thy Soul,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>I ſhall conclude this part (of vain Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) with one memorable example recorded,<note place="margin">

               <p>now our Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts would have people believe that they have attained to a Pouder, Tincture, Elixir, or Stone of the Philoſophers, which will ſeparate all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity from the Bodies of all Mettals, and change it into fine Gold; which I believe, but when they have got this fine Gold, it will but make the old Proverb good, that is, a man may buy Gold too dear; for he that blows away (in a teſt) all the impurity (as I may ſay) of about a pound of Silver; and it may be ſhall ſcarce have one dram of this fine Gold, ſo had better ſit ſtill; for the ſeparating of Metals from their impurity, leaves but little for the Workman; therefore they had better be ſilent than write of tranſmutation of Metals into fine Gold, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they can change them in ſubſtance, colour and quality as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Note, That it was much in my heart to write ſomething of theſe things, becauſe that many of great wits (ſo called) are deceived by the Philoſophical writers of this and former Ages, and ſuch wits are the moſt apt to deceive others, in things that are beyond the reach of mortal man, to new create, or ſo much change nature, as aforeſaid, and ſo comes to be elevated in his mind, and to boaſt of high attainments in theſe things; deceiving himſelf as well as others, by ſeeking and preparing Earthly Treaſures above the Heavenly; for he that has attained to know
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104906:140"/>God, he need ſeek no further, for his Riches no man can take from him, it's beyond the fineſt Gold, becauſe it's everlaſting; yea, it's a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo to the true Chriſtian; but not of this world, (where all things fade.) Now ſome men, having their hearts in the Earth, have found a Kingdom there, called a Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (by <hi>W.

               <p>IT is a ſad age in which we live, that rich, earthly minded men ſhould ſeek to keep the poor people always very poor. <hi>The Cattle upon the thouſands of Hills are mine, ſaith the Lord,</hi> which God intended for the poor, as well as others, even for a general good; And beſides the large Common-grounds in <hi>England</hi> the Rich keep from the Poor, in a great meaſure, which properly is their right, or ſo much thereof, to keep their Families from want, but not to live in idleneſs; for ſome Chriſtian ſpirited people did, in former ages, give Land as common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Poor; but we too often ſee, how that Rich men by force take it from them, That many Lords of Towns, ſo called, and other rich Commoners, had rather hinder themſelves (in ſome things,) that they may lord it over the poor, and hinder a general Improvement of Land, than to benefit the poor, by letting
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104906:151"/>them encloſe a ſmall part of a Common, to maintain their Families, (though the poor may have friends raiſed to give the value of it in Mony;) but are rather for having a Law to maintain them very poorly by collections; whenas the Poor might improve Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground for a general good, and pay taxes. Such oppreſſion on the poor, is no fruit of a Chriſtian Spirit, which is to do unto the poor as they would be dealt with, if they were in the poors condition; The Nation being big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintain ten times as many people (I ſuppoſe) as are now in it, by a Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the Laws put in execution againſt Drunkenneſs, and other the abuſes of good things, the which is of the greateſt concern, that the Magiſtrats ought to look after: And the Poor, as well as others, ought to learn the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Leſſon, that is, to be content in all conditions, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he had learned, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.11. Then will none of the poor in a contentious angry Spirit, ſtrive to get in ground encloſed from the Common, but rather patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait upon God, until he ſhall be pleaſed to open the hearts of men in outward Power, to grant them their Birth-right, and to become ſharers with them of the Earth, (that all may ſeek a General Good, and not ſo much for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt;) then will there be a Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their Labours, ſo as none covet to have more than is needful, to ſpend it upon their

Printed for <hi>Nath. Crouch</hi> at the <hi>Bell</hi> in <hi>Exchange-Alley, London.</hi> In the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was a great famine in <hi>England,</hi> about the year 1245, whereby the Poor miſerably periſhed for want of Bread. The Authors of thoſe times relate this ſtory very credibly, to ſhew how diſpleaſing Unmercifulneſs and want of Charity is in the ſight of God; ſeveral poor People plucked the Ears of Corn, while they were green in the Common fields, meerly to keep themſelves from ſtarving, at which the owners
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104906:152"/>being much offended, deſired the Prieſt of the Pariſh to curſe and excommunicate them all the next <hi>Sunday:</hi> But one of the Company adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prieſt in the name of God, to exempt his Corn from the Sentence, ſaying, <q>That it pleaſed him well, that the poor being pinched with Famine, had taken his Corn; and ſo commended what was left to the bleſſing of God.</q> The Prieſt being compelled by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of others, had no ſooner begun the Sentence, but a ſudden Tempeſt of Thunder, Lightning, Wind, Hail, and Rain, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, whereby all the Corn fields therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout were laid waſte and deſtroyed, as if they had been trodden under Foot with Cart and Horſes; yea, no kind of Fowl nor Beaſt would feed upon it: But this honeſt, tender hearted man found all his Corn and Ground, though mingled among others, altogether untouched, and without the leaſt harm. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor, reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, hath mercy on the poor.</hi>

The ſame blaſting hath alſo come upon many, that have bought up corn in times of ſcarcity, to withold it from the poor by great prices, which is well known to many in this year 1681. as in ages paſt; And do not they alſo rob the poor, that take away the Gleanings of the Grain in the common fields from the poor, whether it be by the Farmer, or ſuch others as are not really poor; But ſome may ſay, <hi>Who are the poor that thou writes of?</hi> I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> He or ſhe that hath nothing but wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apparel, and he that hath a Wife, or a Wife and Children, and works hard for 8 <abbr>d.</abbr> or 10 <abbr>d.</abbr> a day, and hath not above 60 <abbr>l.</abbr> value in Land or Money. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.9, 10. <hi>When ye reap the harveſt of your Land, (ſaith the Lord) ye ſhall not reap every corner of your field, neither ſhalt thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gleanings of thy harveſt: But thou ſhalt leave them for the poor, and Fatherleſs, and Stranger; I am the Lord your God.</hi> Matth. 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt.

            <p>LET none wonder that I call ſome part of this Book a Primmer for Children; ſince my Soul loves innocence, and the true Childs State, and a Primmer only was my firſt deſign, but ſince ſo many things are added, I thought good to intitle it a <hi>Manual,</hi> therefore, where any has run into by-paths upon the barren Mountains of outſide Religion (and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not in the heart, but a talk of Religion
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:104906:189"/>only in the head or tongue) muſt come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to this innocent Childs State, to the <hi>Alpha,</hi> or the beginning, to the A B C in Chriſts School (Gods Grace in the heart, the juſt mans path, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. that reproves for evil) to have peace in God, ſo ſhall their Religion, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be in the ſubſtance (Chriſt Jeſus) not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy, nor tinctured with heatheniſh learning, through Philoſophy, and vain deceit, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>And therefore Reader, apply thy whole heart to Gods Grace therein, and God will teach thee to profit in all good things who alone can drive away all darkneſs and errour out of thy heart (and not to be drawn from the obedience of Gods Grace by any mans words or actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, leaſt thy portion be with the young Prophet, leaſt thy portion be with the young Prophet, whom the old deceived, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. not minding his own gift given him of God, before anothers) ſo ſhall thy mind be fixed, and ſtayed in the way of righteouſneſs; and will give unto God all the honour and praiſe, (from whence alone all good cometh) not unto man, nor any thing of Man, whoſe imaginations are evil, when at any time he turns his mind (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own wiſdom) from his true guide (Gods Word, Spirit, or Grace in his conſcience, <hi>Pſalms</hi> 119.9. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 30.20.) which Spirit was the only rule that the Righteous walked by, before the holy Scriptures were written or printed in paper (the ſame at this day, bleſſed be the Lord God, he hath not left himſelf without a witneſs
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:104906:189"/>for Righteouſneſs in every conſcience) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written are a Rule, but not the chief Rule, now they that hold it to be their chief Rule, ought by it to learn to love their enemies, being it is therein written; but indeed that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, before they turn their whole mind and ſoul to the ſaid chief Rule (Gods Grace) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power alſo, to be kept (by it) out of the many evils that are in the world, <hi>John</hi> 17.15.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of making the Scriptures their Rule, the Prieſts meanings from the Scriptures is injoyned for a Rule, which breeds the great diſunion (at this day) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if nothing but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was read in publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for worſhip (for nothing of mans framing,<note place="margin">See p. of unifor.</note> and making is ſo good) and ſee how many Diſſenters there will be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no interpreter, but Gods Talent of Grace in every heart (to himſelf) by which People knows good from evil, and by it can alſo ſee and diſcern ſuch as profeſs Religion (only) as a Cloak for ſelf-intereſt, from ſuch as are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious indeed, that follow after Righteouſneſs, and ſeek the good of all People in general (being Gods Workmanſhip) that is Godly, dwelling in the ſame love one to another, as God hath for us all <hi>(that would not the death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)</hi> in his ſending plentiful ſeaſons, <hi>&amp;c.
